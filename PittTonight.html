                    Human trafficking is a critical and rampant issue that over 21 million victims are coerced into around the world. Anyone can become a victim of human trafficking, especially those who are in a state of vulnerability. Human trafficking takes occurs in many forms such as working for little or no pay, forced prostitution and debt bondage. More often than less, we don't recognize these events taking place all around us. Our campaign, #iGottaFeeling is targeted to establish a platform for educating the younger generations on the alerting signs of human trafficking and how to prevent being put in a vulnerable situation. We want to be a resourceful outlet in guiding a movement with your help towards a safer and more loving world. Let's Stop This Traffic!
